# CSE 482 Honors Project: Toy Math App To Capture Human Interactions
## Author: Aman Todi


## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to study how users interact with a bunch of math tools to find the set of rectangle dimensions which is closest to a square out of 4 given sets of rectangle dimensions.


## Use
The front end application lets users interact with a calculator and a ratio slider and then pick a set of rectangle dimensions that are closest to a square. These interactions are captured with a time stap attached to them and stored in a Firebase database. An expert with a relevant background can then use the data to study human interactions with the math tools and provide individual as well as group insights.
